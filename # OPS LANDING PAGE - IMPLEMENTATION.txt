- Borders, hovers, section dividers → gray scale only
- Cards hover → gray-300 border (not accent)
- Accordion active → gray-300 border (not accent)
- Phone mockup glow → gray (not accent blue)

- Floating button: fixed top-4 right-4, z-1100, round, dark bg + backdrop-blur, border
- Three bars animate to X via Framer Motion (rotate ±45°, middle fades)
- Backdrop: gradient from right (rgba(0,0,0,0.9) → transparent)
- Panel: slides in from right, 280px wide, spring physics
